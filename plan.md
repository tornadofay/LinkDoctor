# LinkDoctor - Network Diagnostics and Monitoring System

## Mission
Provide comprehensive network diagnostics and monitoring to precisely identify the source of connectivity issues, enabling users to quickly resolve network problems by pinpointing the exact point of failure in the connection chain.

## Core Objectives

1. **Continuous Connection Monitoring**
   - Monitor internet connectivity in real-time
   - Detect connection drops immediately
   - Track connection quality metrics (latency, stability)
   - Lightweight resource usage
     - Minimal CPU and memory footprint
     - Efficient network polling

2. **Layered Diagnostics**
   - Local Network Layer
     - Network interface status
     - Local network configuration
     - DHCP functionality
   - Gateway Layer
     - Router accessibility
     - Local DNS resolution
     - Gateway configuration
   - ISP Layer
     - Last-mile connectivity
     - ISP DNS servers
     - Backbone connection status
   - Internet Layer
     - End-to-end connectivity
     - External service availability
     - Global DNS resolution

3. **Problem Localization**
   - Identify exact failure point in connection chain
   - Distinguish between:
     - Hardware issues (network card, cables)
     - Local network problems (router, switch)
     - ISP service issues
     - External service failures

4. **User Communication**
   - Clear, non-technical problem descriptions
   - Specific troubleshooting recommendations
   - Real-time status updates
   - Historical connection data
   - Visual Performance Monitoring
     - Real-time ping response graph
     - Show ping timeouts as visual indicators
     - Fixed time labels on grid (5s intervals)
     - Continuous scrolling with stationary time scale
     - Professional, clean UI design

5. **User Experience**
   - Intuitive interface requiring no technical knowledge
   - Clear visual indicators of connection status
   - Minimal setup and configuration required
   - Responsive and smooth performance display
   - System tray integration for background monitoring
   - Easy access to detailed diagnostics when needed

## Success Criteria
- Accurate identification of network problems
- Clear communication of issues to users
- Minimal false positives/negatives
- Quick problem detection and diagnosis
- Actionable troubleshooting steps
- Efficient resource utilization
